# Node-RED Jacdac Node

[Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware and software stack for microcontrollers and their peripherals such as sensors and actuators. Jacdac is primarily designed for “modular electronics” scenarios that support rapid prototyping, creative exploration, making and learning through physical computing. Jacdac is designed to be cheap, flexible and extensible.

## Requirements

This node uses [node-usb](https://github.com/tessel/node-usb) which has specific installation requirements.


## Adding Nodes

You can quickly scaffold a new node and add it to the node set. Use the following command to create `my-new-node-type` node:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type
```

The node generator is based on mustache templates. At the moment there are three templates available:

- `blank` (used by default) - basic node for Node-RED >=1.0
- `blank-0` - node with a backward compatibility for running on Node-RED <1.0
- `config` - configuration node

To generate a node using a template, specify it as the third argument:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type blank
```

or

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-config config
```

## Developing Nodes

Build & Test in Watch mode:

```
yarn dev
```

## Building Node Set

Create a production build:

```
yarn build
```
